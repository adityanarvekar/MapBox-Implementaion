I have implemented the coding exercise by using the MapBox Api.

It took me a day to create this application.

I chose this api because it offered not only the features required for implementing the coding exercise but also many other features
which can be useful for location based applications.

This is the sharable link of the video I screen recorded of my phone running the app.

This is the first iteration of the app.

I will be exploring other functionalities of the API in coming days to create a more perfect version of the application.

Update:-

In second iteration, I have handled the test case in which the information that will be displayed if user terminates the navigation
midway before reaching his/her location.
